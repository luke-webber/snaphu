Bugs And Bug Reporting
----------------------

Not all parts of snaphu have been well tested, so your bug reports and
feedback are appreciated.  Please email them to

  curtis@nova.stanford.edu

The man page included with the distribution lists known issues as
well.  Thanks, and good luck with the unwrapping.


Notes on Compiling
------------------

To compile, cd to src directory, make && make install. This repository
has been tested and working on Mac OS X 10.10.4, requires XCode Command
Line Tools.

The CS2 MCF solver module is governed by the terms of the original
authors (see the README.copyright file).  In order to compile snaphu
without this module, specify -D NO_CS2 as a compiler option in the
Makefile.


Run-Time Configuration Files
----------------------------

Two template run-time configuration files are provided in the config
directory.  The file snaphu.conf.brief contains the configuration
parameters that a beginning user might need to specify.  The file
snaphu.conf.full contains all the options that the program will
accept.
